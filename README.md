# File Renamer

This Python program renames many files at once. Via the command line it lets the user choose a directory and replace all occurences of a certain string in the file names with another string. For example, if a directory has files `Image1`, `Image2`, etc. they can be renamed to `picture_1`, `picture_2`, etc. at once.
